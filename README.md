# Hello! I'm Alex.

I generally work on:
- Deep packet inspection firewall circumvention tools ([**Hypertunnel**](https://github.com/Alex-Programs/hypertunnel))
- Personal automation tools
- Browser extensions (both for personal use and [**Nuenki**](https://nuenki.app?utm_source=ghprofile))
- Small webapps
- Projects with friends, sometimes in public repos ([**Starmap**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap), [**VTOL VR Viewer**](https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLLiveViewerClient)) and sometimes in private ones
- Contributions to open source projects that interest me.

I've also done two week's work experience at [**Microsoft Research Cambridge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/about/offices/cambridge/), where among other things I built [**a tool**](https://github.com/Alex-Progrmas/ORBIT-CC-comparison) for calculating statistics about the effectiveness of the [**ORBIT dataset**](https://github.com/microsoft/ORBIT-Dataset) with the Azure cognitive services API and worked on an early prototype mockup of the [**MUSE**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/) world-and-human-action model.

I used to do a lot of programming with [**Collective-SB**](https://github.com/Collective-SB) in private repositories, collaborating on technical infrastructure for a 500-person gaming group. These included systems that pulled ingame position data using OCR and showed our positions on a [**live 3D map**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap/commits/master?author=Alex-Programs), Discord bots for ingame blueprint sharing and progress leaderboards, an unfinished secure Discord alternative, and an OCR-based monitor of the ingame auction house.

<!-- TODO: https://github.com/Collective-SB/zone-alert-ocr, https://github.com/Collective-SB/hud-overlay, https://github.com/Collective-SB/reddit-observer when SB is well and truly dead, I know nobody's actually reading this repo so a few links are alright. -->

Python and Rust are my most used languages, but I also know JS, TS, and a little C#. I'm currently working on Nuenki, and before that I built a new method for circumventing firewalls based on smuggling data in HTTP requests without SSE, request streaming, or Websockets - [**Hypertunnel**](github.com/Alex-Programs/hypertunnel).

I also write about LLM translation in [**Nuenki's Blog**](https://nuenki.app/blog), and maintain its LLM translation performance benchmark.

You can contact me at ``alexc.j`` on Discord, email alex [at] nuenki [dot app], or open an issue in [**this repository**](https://github.com/Alex-Programs/Alex-Programs).
