# Hello! I'm Alex.

I generally work on:
- Small webapps
- Personal automation tools
- Browser extensions (both for personal use and [**Nuenki**](https://nuenki.app))
- Deep packet inspection firewall circumvention tools (Currently in a private repo; I will soon clean it up and release it)
- Projects with friends, sometimes in public repos ([**Starmap**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap), [**VTOL VR Viewer**](https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLLiveViewerClient)) and sometimes in private ones
- Contributions to open source projects that interest me.

I've also done a week's work experience at [**Microsoft Research Cambridge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/about/offices/cambridge/), where among other things I built [**a tool**](https://github.com/Alex-Progrmas/ORBIT-CC-comparison) for calculating statistics about the effectiveness of the [**ORBIT dataset**](https://github.com/microsoft/ORBIT-Dataset) with the Azure cognitive services API.

I used to do a lot of programming with [**Collective-SB**](https://github.com/Collective-SB) in private repositories, collaborating on technical infrastructure for a 500-person gaming group. These included systems that pulled ingame position data using OCR and showed our positions on a [**live 3D map**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap/commits/master?author=Alex-Programs), Discord bots for ingame blueprint sharing and progress leaderboards, an unfinished Discord alternative, and an OCR-based monitor of the ingame auction house.

<!-- TODO: https://github.com/Collective-SB/zone-alert-ocr, https://github.com/Collective-SB/hud-overlay, https://github.com/Collective-SB/reddit-observer when SB is well and truly dead, I know nobody's actually reading this repo so a few links are alright. -->

Python is the language I know best, but I also know JS, TS, Rust, and a little C#. I'm currently working on Nuenki, and before that I built a new method for circumventing firewalls based on smuggling data in HTTP requests without SSE, request streaming, or Websockets. That's not yet open source because it was a school project and I need to clean up the personal details.

You can contact me at ``alexc.j`` on Discord or open an issue in [**this repository**](https://github.com/Alex-Programs/Alex-Programs).
