# Hello! I'm Alex.

I previously went by [AlexAndHisScripts](https://github.com/AlexAndHisScripts).

----------

I generally work on:
- Little webapps
- Personal automation tools
- Browser extensions (For personal use - in private repos for the time being)
- Deep packet inspection firewall circumvention tools (Will remain in private repos until I leave my current school)
- Learning projects
- Projects with friends, sometimes in public repos ([**Starmap**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap), [**VTOL VR Viewer**](https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLLiveViewerClient)) and sometimes in private ones
- Contributions to open source projects that interest me.

I've also done a week's work experience at [**Microsoft Research Cambridge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/about/offices/cambridge/), where among other things I built [**a tool**](https://github.com/Alex-Progrmas/ORBIT-CC-comparison) for calculating statistics about the effectiveness of the [**ORBIT dataset**](https://github.com/microsoft/ORBIT-Dataset) with the Azure cognitive services API.

I used to do a lot of programming with [**Collective-SB**](https://github.com/Collective-SB) in private repositories, collaborating on technical infrastructure for a 500-person gaming group. These included systems that pulled ingame positions data using OCR and showed our positions on a [**live 3D map**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap/commits/master?author=Alex-Programs), Discord bots for ingame blueprint sharing and progress leaderboards, and an OCR-based monitor of the ingame auction house.

<!-- TODO: https://github.com/Collective-SB/zone-alert-ocr, https://github.com/Collective-SB/hud-overlay, https://github.com/Collective-SB/reddit-observer when SB is well and truly dead, I know nobody's actually reading this repo so a few links are alright. -->

The language I know best is Python, but I also know JS, TS, and a little Rust/C#/Go. I'm currently learning Rust, Go, and Kubernetes, and plan to learn Haskell after that.

Me and [**Jack Whitehorn**](https://github.com/jw2476) have been working on [**Quark**](https://github.com/quark-proj), but it's far from completion and without any public repositories yet. We've been looking into using the excellent work of the [**Bytecode Alliance**](https://bytecodealliance.org/) as a part of it, so are likely to contribute to their projects in the future.

You can find me at ``IHave#7106`` on Discord or open an issue in [**this repository**](https://github.com/Alex-Programs/Alex-Programs).
