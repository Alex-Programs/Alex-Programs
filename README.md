I generally work on:
- Little webapps
- Personal automation tools
- Browser extensions (For personal use - in private repos for the time being)
- Deep packet inspection firewall circumvention tools (Will remain in private repos until I leave my current school)
- Learning projects
- Projects with friends, sometimes in public repos ([**Starmap**](https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap), [**VTOL VR Viewer**](https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLLiveViewerClient)) and sometimes in private ones.
- Contributions to open source projects that interest me.

I've also done a week's work experience at Microsoft in Cambridge, where among other things I made a tool for calculating statistics about the effectiveness of the ORBIT dataset with the Azure cognitive services API:

I used to do a lot of programming with [**Collective-SB**](https://github.com/Collective-SB) in private repositories, collaborating on infrastructure with a gaming faction.

The language I know best is Python, but I also know JS, TS, and a little Rust/C#/Go. I'm currently learning Rust, Go, and Kubernetes, and plan to learn Haskell after that.

Me and [**Jack Whitehorn**](https://github.com/jw2476) have been working on [**Quark**](https://github.com/quark-proj), but it's far from completion and without any public repositories yet. We've been looking into using the excellent work of the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/) as a part of it, so are likely to contribute to that in the future as well.

You can find me at ``IHave#7106`` on Discord.
