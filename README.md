I do some programming with [**Collective-SB**](https://github.com/Collective-SB) in private repositories, collaborating on infrastructure with a gaming faction.

I generally work on:
- Little webapps
- Personal automation tools
- Browser extensions (For personal use - in private repos for the time being)
- Deep packet inspection firewall circumvention tools (Will remain in private repos until I leave my current school)
- Learning projects
- Projects with friends, sometimes in public repos (https://github.com/Collective-SB/Starmap, https://github.com/Strikeeaglechase/VTOLLiveViewerClient) and sometimes in private ones.

I've also done a week's work experience at Microsoft in Cambridge, where among other things I made a tool for getting statistics about the effectiveness of the ORBIT dataset with the Azure cognitive services API:

I mostly program in Python, but I also know JS, TS, and a little Rust/Elixir/C#.

You can find me at ``IHave#7106`` on Discord.
